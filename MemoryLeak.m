In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error stems from the misuse of `retain` and `release` in manual memory management (MRC).  Specifically, it involves unintentionally creating retain cycles, where objects hold strong references to each other, preventing the system from deallocating them. This is especially tricky with delegate patterns or nested object structures.  A subtle coding mistake could lead to memory leaks that only surface under specific usage patterns, making them hard to debug.
